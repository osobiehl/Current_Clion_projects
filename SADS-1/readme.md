# how to build
    idk use the cmake, executable names are:
     test_stack : tests everything (I'm lazy with names)
     SADS_1 : rpnc executable
     Since I'm using Clion, executables are built out of cmake-build-debug directory. If this is too complex 
     let me know and I will use Cmake properly next time.
